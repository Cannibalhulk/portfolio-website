## What is UI library?

A UI (User Interface) library is a collection of pre-written UI components and tools for building UI interfaces for websites and applications. It provides common UI elements such as buttons, forms, icons, and typography, along with interactive components such as dropdown menus, modal windows, and carousels. The purpose of a UI library is to simplify the UI development process and make it easier for developers to create attractive, functional, and consistent UI interfaces.
