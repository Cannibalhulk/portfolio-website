Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed by the constant pursuit of multiple goals? I've always been an ambitious person, constantly driven to achieve more and set higher goals for myself. But over time, I started to realize that this relentless pursuit was becoming overwhelming. I felt like I was always juggling multiple projects, trying to excel in various areas of my life simultaneously.

That's when I stumbled upon the concept of "Monk Mode." The idea intrigued meâ€”a deliberate practice of simplifying and narrowing down goals to only the most essential ones.

I decided to give "Monk Mode" a try. I took a step back from the chaos and noise of my daily life, and I began reflecting on what truly mattered to me. I asked myself, **"What are my core passions and aspirations? What goals align with my authentic self?"**.  And you should do it too.

Monk Mode is a 4-steps "protocol". Let's go over the 4 steps.

## Step 1 - The Direction

The main idea of step 1 is to set reasonable goals. If we don't have reasonable goals, we're gonna end up in our previous position again. 

So, the goal is like a "navigation". If you sit in a car, you know where you are going. If you know what are you genuinely like to achieve in life, then you focus on the goal itself. 

To understand the first step I took out a piece of paper and wrote down **"My Goals To Be Done By End of This Year"**. There should be 5-10 goals that, you want to make them happen. *This method is the reference from youtuber Hamza's video*.

Once I've done completing my goals, decided about **"what 1, 2 or 3 goals that matters most rather than others"**. And quickly circled those goals. Other goals that remained uncircled  **crossed them out**.

No, why I am doing this? Because it is these goals that {% mark %}stopping{% /mark %} me to achieve the ones in the circle. It's sure that why most successful people have less number of goals. In that way they have less distraction.

By limiting my goals, I discovered a newfound sense of clarity and focus. I was able to prioritize what truly mattered, freeing myself from the overwhelming burden of trying to accomplish everything at once. I realized that setting too many goals only spread my energy thin, leaving me exhausted and unfulfilled. With a more streamlined approach, I could direct my energy, time, and resources towards a few key areas.

## Step 2 - The Distractions

In today's digital age, distractions are plentiful and easily accessible. Social media notifications, endless email threads, and the allure of mindless scrolling can pull us away from the tasks that truly matter. I have fallen victim to these distractions countless times, succumbing to the temptation of instant gratification and the illusion of productivity. However, I have come to realize that fallen to distractions only leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled potential.

"Monk Mode" revealed to me the strength of simplicity. I cleared away distractions, fostering an environment for deep work. With fewer goals, I could fully engage in focused.

## Step 3 - The basic attack

Basic attack is the habit that quickly become active when you have nothing to do. It is kind of our bad habits. Through out my day my basic attack was to scroll down unrelentlessly  social media. And that habit became "online" when I didn't have anything to do. **When we removed our bad habits (basic attack) but didn't replace it anything else, certainly, it is unevitable to go back our bad days again.** So I need to change that something productive.

*So I decided to evaluate that time reading books and listening 1-2 hours long podcasts.* 

## Step 4 - The 1 Task Rule

In the step 1, we found out our most prioritized goals. In this step I ask myself **"What is the most important, crucial, 80% that would get me to ???? "**. The answer of this question is the key to be successful through out the process. I have to do that particular task over and over again.

However, it's important to note that my journey of self-improvement is ongoing. I am still learning, growing, and fine-tuning my approach. "Monk Mode" has become an integral part of my life, reminding me to continuously reevaluate my goals and make conscious choices. It serves as a reminder to stay focused, to keep things simple, and to embrace the process of continuous improvement.
